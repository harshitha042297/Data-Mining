DATA MINING FINAL PROJECT (CSCI-B565)

Project Title:
Airbnb Recommendation System

Abstract:
Airbnb is a platform that helps hosts to lease homestays on a shortterm basis. Guests can view dates available, pricing options, location, neighborhood, amenities, etc. This is the most widely used platform across the globe. The guests must surface through all the options according to their preference with the help of various filters available. With several options available, it confuses the user in selecting the right option. We had to develop a system where the user enters their annual income to predict the room type and location most suitable for the user since New York City (NYC) is one of the most happening cities in the world. We have selected four different portions of New York City as inputs for our model. We have collected data with different room types which are most preferred by customers. We figured out the parameters that effect the cost of living in a certain allocation and fed that to the recommender system.
